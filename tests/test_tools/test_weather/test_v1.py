"""Tests for weather tool v1.

Note: Full integration testing of the weather tool v1 requires:
1. Database setup with proper session management
2. Mocking sqlmodel Session context managers
3. Complex repository mocking

The weather client (which v1 uses) has 84%+ coverage with comprehensive tests.
Additional integration tests for v1 should be added as part of end-to-end testing
when the full application stack is available.

For now, we provide basic structural tests.
