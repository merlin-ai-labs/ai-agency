## Key Issues Documented

### /healthz Endpoint Routing Issue

**Problem**: The `/healthz` endpoint returns 404 from Cloud Run, even though:
- It's defined in `app/main.py`
- It appears in the OpenAPI specification
- Other endpoints work correctly

**Symptom**:
```bash
$ curl https://ai-agency-4ebxrg4hdq-ew.a.run.app/healthz
# Returns Google's 404 page (not FastAPI's 404)
```

**Root Cause**: Unknown - under investigation

**Possible Causes**:
1. Cloud Run health check path conflict
2. ASGI/Uvicorn routing issue
3. Cloud Run service configuration problem
4. FastAPI route priority issue

**Impact**: Low - workarounds available

**Workaround**:
```bash
# Use /docs endpoint for health checks
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  https://ai-agency-4ebxrg4hdq-ew.a.run.app/docs
# Returns: 200
```

**Status**: Documented in all relevant files, to be investigated in Wave 2

**Documented In**:
- README.md (Known Issues section)
- DEPLOYMENT.md (Known Issues section with full analysis)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (Health Checks section)
- CHANGELOG.md (v0.2.1 release notes)
- WAVE1_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md (Full investigation and recommendations)
