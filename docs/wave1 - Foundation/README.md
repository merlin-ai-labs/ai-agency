# Wave 1 - Foundation (Complete)

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Production
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-28
**Production URL:** https://ai-agency-4ebxrg4hdq-ew.a.run.app

## What Was Built

Wave 1 established the foundational infrastructure for the AI Consulting Agency Platform.

### Infrastructure Deployed

**Production (GCP):**
- Cloud Run service (ai-agency) in europe-west1
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension
- GCS bucket for artifact storage
- Secret Manager for credentials
- Artifact Registry for container images

**CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions automated testing (`ci.yml`)
- GitHub Actions automated deployment (`deploy.yml`)
- Database migrations on deployment
- Smoke tests post-deployment

**Local Development:**
- Docker Compose for PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Python venv setup scripts
- Hot reload with uvicorn
- Alembic migrations

### Code Delivered

**Core Infrastructure (`app/core/`):**
- `base.py` - Base classes for tools, flows, adapters
- `exceptions.py` - Exception hierarchy
- `decorators.py` - @retry, @timeout, @log_execution
- `types.py` - Type definitions and Pydantic models

**Database Layer (`app/db/`):**
- SQLModel models (Run, Tenant, DocumentChunk)
- Session management with async
- Alembic migration setup
- Multi-cloud connection support (GCP, AWS, Azure, local)

**API Layer (`app/api/`):**
- FastAPI application structure
- Health check endpoint
- Stub endpoints for flows (/runs, /runs/{id})

**Adapters (`app/adapters/`):**
- LLM factory pattern
- OpenAI adapter (stub)
- Vertex AI adapter (stub)

**Tools & Flows:**
- Tool registry system
- Stub flow implementations (maturity_assessment, usecase_grooming)

### What's NOT Implemented Yet

These are placeholders for Wave 2+:
- ❌ Actual LLM integration (adapters are stubs)
- ❌ RAG implementation (ingestion/retrieval are stubs)
- ❌ Business logic tools (5 core tools are stubs)
- ❌ Flow orchestration (LangGraph integration pending)
- ❌ Authentication/authorization
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ Comprehensive test coverage (currently 8%)

## Key Decisions

**Architecture:**
- Monorepo, not microservices
- Database-backed queue instead of Pub/Sub
- Async-first with FastAPI
- Multi-LLM support via adapter pattern

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector for vector search
- Cloud SQL in production
- Docker container locally
- Alembic for schema migrations

**Deployment:**
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (not Cloud Build)
- Cloud Run for compute (not GKE)
- Secret Manager for credentials (not .env in production)
- Artifact Registry for containers

**Cloud Provider:**
- Primary: GCP (europe-west1)
- Portable: Can switch to AWS RDS or Azure Database via DATABASE_URL

## Production Configuration

**Service:**
- URL: https://ai-agency-4ebxrg4hdq-ew.a.run.app
- Region: europe-west1 (Belgium)
- Auto-scaling: 0-100 instances

**Database:**
- Cloud SQL instance: ai-agency-db
- Connection: Via Cloud SQL Proxy (unix socket)
- Backups: Automated daily

**Secrets (in Secret Manager):**
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- DATABASE_PASSWORD (if needed)

**Storage:**
- GCS bucket: merlin-ai-agency-artifacts-eu

## Team Handoff

**For Wave 2 Development:**
1. Infrastructure is ready - just build features
2. Push to main auto-deploys to production
3. Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env for local dev
4. See [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for how to build flows

**What to Focus On:**
- Implement actual LLM adapters (replace stubs)
- Build the 5 core business logic tools
- Implement RAG ingestion and retrieval
- Write comprehensive tests (target 80% coverage)
- Implement flow orchestration with LangGraph

## Known Issues

**Production:**
- `/healthz` endpoint returns 404 (Cloud Run routing issue)
- Workaround: Use `/health` or `/docs` endpoint instead

**Testing:**
- Coverage is low (8%) - Wave 1 focused on infrastructure
- Wave 2 will implement comprehensive test suite

## Lessons Learned

**What Worked Well:**
- GitHub Actions for deployment (simpler than Cloud Build)
- Database-backed queue (no Pub/Sub complexity)
- Docker Compose for local development
- Alembic migrations in CI/CD pipeline

**What to Watch:**
- Test coverage needs to increase significantly
- LLM costs will add up in production
- Cloud Run cold starts with large dependencies

## Next Steps (Wave 2)

See [wave2/](../wave2/) for Wave 2 planning and test priorities.

**Priority Tasks:**
1. Implement OpenAI adapter with retry logic
2. Implement RAG ingestion with pgvector
3. Build the 5 core tools (parse_docs, score_rubrics, etc.)
4. Write tests for everything (80% coverage target)
5. Implement actual flow orchestration

**Wave 1 is complete and production-ready. Time to build features!**
