#### Issues Found

### CRITICAL ISSUE: /healthz Endpoint Not Accessible

**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Health checks will fail, preventing proper monitoring and potentially affecting Cloud Run's availability detection

**Details:**
- URL: https://ai-agency-847424242737.europe-west1.run.app/healthz
- Expected: 200 OK with JSON response `{"status": "ok", "service": "ai-agency"}`
- Actual: 404 Not Found (Google error page)
- Verified Locally: Works perfectly on localhost:8081

**Evidence:**
1. OpenAPI schema correctly lists `/healthz` endpoint
2. Local testing confirms endpoint exists and returns correct response
3. Cloud Run logs show NO incoming requests to `/healthz` - requests are being intercepted before reaching the service
4. Response headers show `referrer-policy: no-referrer` which differs from working endpoints that show `server: Google Frontend`

**Analysis:**
The issue appears to be at the Google Cloud infrastructure level rather than the application code:
- The endpoint exists in the application (verified locally)
- The endpoint is registered in FastAPI routes (verified in code)
- The OpenAPI schema correctly reflects the endpoint
- Requests never reach Cloud Run (no logs)
- The 404 response comes from Google's infrastructure, not from FastAPI

**Possible Causes:**
1. Reserved route: `/healthz` might be reserved by Google Cloud Platform for internal health checks
2. Load Balancer configuration: If a load balancer is intercepting the path
3. CDN caching issue: Though unlikely for 404s
4. Route configuration: Cloud Run may have special handling for health check paths

**Local Verification:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8081/healthz
{
    "status": "ok",
    "service": "ai-agency"
}
```

**Recommendations:**
1. Use alternative health check endpoint (e.g., `/health` or `/api/health`)
2. Investigate Google Cloud Run's reserved paths documentation
3. Check if Cloud Run has automatic health check configuration that conflicts
4. Consider using Cloud Run's built-in health check configuration instead of application-level endpoint

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Wave 1)
1. **Fix Health Check Endpoint**
   - Rename `/healthz` to `/health` or `/api/health`
   - Update Cloud Run health check configuration
   - Redeploy and verify

2. **Add More Tests for Wave 1 Coverage**
   - Add tests for `app/config.py` (0% coverage)
   - Add tests for `app/logging.py` (0% coverage)
   - Add tests for database models (0% coverage)

### Short-term Improvements (Wave 2)
3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Current: 8.06%
   - Target: 80%
   - Priority modules:
     - LLM adapters (currently 0%)
     - Core base classes (currently 0%)
     - Flow implementations (currently 0%)

4. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Database integration tests
   - LLM provider integration tests (with mocks)
   - End-to-end flow tests

5. **Add E2E Tests**
   - Automated post-deployment smoke tests
   - Full workflow validation on deployed service

### Medium-term Enhancements
6. **CI/CD Improvements**
   - Add pre-commit hooks for running tests
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Add coverage reporting to PRs

7. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Configure proper health checks in Cloud Run
   - Add structured logging for better debugging
   - Set up alerting for test failures

## Summary

### Current State
- All existing tests pass successfully (5/5)
- Coverage meets current threshold (8.06% >= 8%)
- Most deployment endpoints work correctly
- Core application functionality verified

### Blockers
- Health check endpoint not accessible (requires investigation/fix)

### Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix `/healthz` endpoint issue
2. Write tests for uncovered modules to increase coverage
3. Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. Add integration and E2E tests for Wave 2

### Overall Assessment
**Status: MOSTLY SUCCESSFUL with one critical issue to resolve**

The application is deployed and mostly functional. The core API endpoints work correctly, but the health check endpoint needs attention. The test suite is minimal but passing, providing a foundation to build upon in Wave 2.
